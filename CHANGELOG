0.1.0

	* Added support for basic configuration of sndiod, mainly with a focus
	  on the ability to switch audio devices.

	* Switched to using tkinter grids, rather than packed frames for layout,
	  leading to a more visually appealing widget alignment.

	* Added support for switching mixer devices via the "basic" tab by
	  re-starting the application in-place.

0.1.1

	* Revised parsing logic to be regex based, removing the possibility
	  for a number of possible crashes.

	* If the basic tab fails to build, an error dialog is displayed before
	  crashing.
